1) Fade works on the current screen, attached is a .bin file that you can pre-load onto the screen if you wish (This will not be counted towards the final size).
2) ONLY the routine will count, you can add setup code to copy an image to the screen if you wish, that data / code will not count, BUT do not rely on any register values being set to a specific value before your routine starts.
3) As above, ALL registers will be considered random before your routine starts.
4) You must have a clear screen at the end.
5) This is only the PIXEL data, attributes are not considered part of the challenge.
6) Rom routine size will be added if you use any of them
7) You MUST wait for an interrupt (HALT or similar) between each fade/copy step
8) DO NOT!!! Post to other forums asking for help, DO NOT post your code anywhere else.
Lets go with a deadline of midday 19th June... These rules maybe updated as judges see fit.
